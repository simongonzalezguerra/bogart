# bogart
Bogart is a simple graphic application that showcases graphics development with C++14 and Horde3D.

It shows a 3D visualization of the Sponza model using the Horde3D library for rendering and GLFW for window management and user input. The project showcases the following concepts:

* Asynchronous programming with message passing
* The Model-View-Controller pattern
* Rendering and game logic in separate threads

The project is implemented in C++14 and uses the following features:

* The `<thread>` library
* The `<chrono>` library
* Smart pointers with `unique_ptr`
* Lambda
* Move capture
* Lambda capture expressions

  0. `$ sudo apt-get update`
  0. `$ sudo apt-get install g++-4.9`
0. Download the code or clone the repo
0. Cd to the directory where you downloaded the code
0. Build makefiles
   0. `$ mkdir build`
   0. `$ cd build`
   0. `$ cmake ..`
0. Build the code
